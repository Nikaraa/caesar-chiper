# Caesar Chiper
Caesar cipher project for the odin project curriculum made with ruby!

# #ceasar_chiper
The caesar_chiper method takes an array of strings and an integer, and converts the string's words into numbers (following the ASCII code). Then it increments the ASCII code by the integer and retransforms the code into number, returning an encrypted array of string (following the original caesar chyper encryption)
